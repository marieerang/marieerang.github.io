      <h2>ASSIGNMENT</h2>
      <h3>Printer though the Homeoestasis model</h3>
      <p>Artificial Creatures have been popping up everywhere, from the Boston Dynamics robots to movies about artificial intelligences that have real feelings and emotions, it’s hard to miss. But not all robots are “creatures” as they don’t have needs or set behaviour and cannot function on their own. An artificial creature is something that learns, grows, adapts according to its needs and behaviour. More advanced creatures can even change their own behavioural patterns. Another big thing about artificial creatures is empathy. Humans like to empathise with other creatures and understand them. For example a baby monitor could be made to look as a little teddy bear and it would already seem to be a creature on its own humans can empathise with. This sounds all very complicated and advanced technology, but even very simple machines can be seen as creatures. For example, a Roomba has set behaviour, set needs and you just let it do its job. It has a set behaviour to clean the floor and while its doing it, it seems like an entity acting on its own. An example of a Roomba’s need would be energy as it works on a battery and sometimes it needs to charge. It works and lives based on those behaviour patterns and needs.
      </p>
      <p>What I’m going to do is apply the same logic to a printer. A printer needs to have paper and ink cartridges to function properly. It also needs power and some sort of document to print. Since most printers don’t function with a battery, power is a constant and cannot fall under a certain amount a scale: it can be either on or off. Input is also not something measurable so we cannot put that on a scale, but we can set paper and ink as needs on a certain scale. If the paper is out, the printer cannot print, thus it reacts to the paper need being low. If there is low ink, the printer cannot print properly, leaving only very light ink marks on the paper or if there is no ink at all, the printer can’t do anything besides let an empty paper through itself. The printer has needs and it reacts to them in its own way.</p>

          <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
          <p>When it comes to Artificial Creatures, so many come to mind, but when searching for them online, it is really hard to find. My first connection is immediately to AI and the movie Her, where an AI that lives in a whole ecosystem of devices lives and grows and changes behaviour. This, however is not an Artificial Creature, as it’s just an AI. The best examples are from Boston Dynamics, that have such a wide range of creatures. Boston Dynamics was founded in 1992 and from 2013 has been widely known on the internet because of the BigDog they created that went viral on youtube. It’s a four-legged creature that can walk around, has a set purpose and behaviour and can learn from mistakes. The videos that went popular were of people pushing over the BigDog and the BigDog learning to get back up again or even keeping its centre of gravity so well, it doesn’t fall over at all. The videos had mixed comments as some people thought it was just funny to watch and interesting in terms of technological advancements, but others started to empathise with the BigDog as it looked like a dog and they felt sorry for the creature as it was constantly being pushed over. Even though, the dog is not sentient and has no emotion, people felt as it did. This, is in my opinion, is the most interesting part about creating Artificial Creatures.

          <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
          <p>When I first started with the artificial creatures assignment I had to really let go of my judgements and get really creative, but I ended up really liking it in the end. I especially liked the lecture, mostly because I recognised so many of the examples given and it was very interesting to listen to. My favourite part was the Cellular Automata as it’s so simple, but so elegant. I hope I get this topic for the Lab weeks as I think this leaves the most freedom for creativity.</p>
