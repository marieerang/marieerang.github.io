      <h3>Printer though the Homeoestasis model</h3>
      <p>Artificial Creatures have been popping up everywhere, from the Boston Dynamics robots to movies about artificial intelligences that have real feelings and emotions, it’s hard to miss. But not all robots are “creatures” as they don’t have needs or set behaviour and cannot function on their own. An artificial creature is something that learns, grows, adapts according to its needs and behaviour. More advanced creatures can even change their own behavioural patterns. Another big thing about artificial creatures is empathy. Humans like to empathise with other creatures and understand them. For example a baby monitor could be made to look as a little teddy bear and it would already seem to be a creature on its own humans can empathise with. This sounds all very complicated and advanced technology, but even very simple machines can be seen as creatures. For example, a Roomba has set behaviour, set needs and you just let it do its job. It has a set behaviour to clean the floor and while its doing it, it seems like an entity acting on its own. An example of a Roomba’s need would be energy as it works on a battery and sometimes it needs to charge. It works and lives based on those behaviour patterns and needs.
      </p>
      <p>What I’m going to do is apply the same logic to a printer. A printer needs to have paper and ink cartridges to function properly. It also needs power and some sort of document to print. Since most printers don’t function with a battery, power is a constant and cannot fall under a certain amount a scale: it can be either on or off. Input is also not something measurable so we cannot put that on a scale, but we can set paper and ink as needs on a certain scale. If the paper is out, the printer cannot print, thus it reacts to the paper need being low. If there is low ink, the printer cannot print properly, leaving only very light ink marks on the paper or if there is no ink at all, the printer can’t do anything besides let an empty paper through itself. The printer has needs and it reacts to them in its own way.</p>
