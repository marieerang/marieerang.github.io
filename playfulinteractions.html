      <h3>Just Dance in THUAS</h3>
      <p>In our university there is a lack of interactive spaces where students could come together. Yes, we have a chess board and other minor things, but nothing very amusing. The assignment for this topic was to think of some cool playful interactive environment for our school. My first thought was the just dance mornings we had in high school, which I know sound lame, but they were a lot of fun. Every Monday we would have an assembly for 9-12th graders and every class had to organise an assembly at least once a year. When it was our turn, we thought of how tired we are of sitting down and listening to some boring lecture by some class about their trip somewhere. We wanted to do something fun and physical, so we told everyone to put away their chairs and gather in middle of the hall. We put on a youtube video of the game Just Dance and told everyone to dance along. At first people laughed, but 3 songs in, everyone was having fun, feeling energised and happy. I asked various people from different classes during the day if that made any difference to their Monday and I always got the same answer: that they were exhilarated, happy and focused all day. Then I started doing this with my roommate last year every morning we had class at the same time and needed to take the same train.

      <p>There is enough room in the university for a space allocated to this. If the space is private enough, people can engage in this activity alone or in pairs, but bigger groups can use this too. For a small enough group, it can be an actual Just Dance (or similar) game played on for example Wii. Then it would not just be a fun activity with your friend to get energised, but also a competition (parallel comparing), with a bigger group of people it becomes just a situation where everyone is aware of everyone around them engaging in the same activity and enjoying it (parallel knowing). The game in essence is about mimicking dance moves seen on the screen (parallel matching).

        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>I quite liked this topic as I got to revisit some good memories. It was interesting to look at existing projects to and admire what people have already achieved and come up with. I see tremendous potential for projects about interactive environments - they can help people with any situation. I had no real expectations for this topic as I tried my best to keep an open mind about all the topics as to not limit myself.</p>
