      <h2>HCI PORTFOLIO FOR MODULE 4</h2>
      <p>Welcome to my HCI (Human-Computer Interaction) portfolio. I'm Marie Elisa and I study User Experience Design at The Hague University of Applied Sciences, where we had a course called HCI. Here you can find all of the work I did during that course that lead up to Lab Weeks, where along with my team I built a little robot we called M.A.R.V.I.N and of course everything about those weeks is on there too.
      </p>
      <p>What I expected from this course was to discover new technologies and explore new concepts I had no idea existed. Of course since User Experience Design is a technological and digital field, we already have explored so many wonderful technologies and been to see various exciting installations, so I had high hopes for this course. I knew we were going to have to make a big project in the end, which could be anything from a VR environment to a robot and it made me incredibly nervous, because I was convinced I was not capable of this. I am very proud of myself and my teammates and this was an exceptionally fun course!</p>
