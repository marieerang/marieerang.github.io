      <h3>How to use AR or VR in a useful way in different fields?</h3>
        <ol>
          <li>Infrastructure: Our university, THUAS, is a very big building which doesn’t always make sense. Even less sense makes the huge Erasmus MC complex in Rotterdam. There are all sorts of apps and gadgets to help us navigate outdoors, but sometimes we could use a bit of help inside too. For example you are dealing with a new building and are running late for an appointment, but can’t find the right place. I propose an AR based navigation app for buildings like universities, hospitals, big offices, etc. You could put in the room number of where you need to go, turn on the camera and see a clear path in real time on your screen, easy to follow. It would have to work with some sorts of markers on the floors and/or walls to make sure the app follows your location correctly and you arrive on time at your destination. .</li>
          <li>Art / museums: When walking around art museums today you’ll notice most people are on their phones, taking pictures of the artwork and not really that present. I was thinking that if people are already on their phones we could have a whole AR environment. If guests hold up their camera to a painting or a sculpture, a marker (like the Hiro marker from the computer vision assignment) would show them interesting information about the artwork in a clear and concise way, like information is packaged today: the date, artist and some story about the painting, but overlaid on the marker or actual artwork, not just like scanned like a QR code.</li>
          <li>Sports: When at a football game or a track&field event, wouldn’t it be cool to keep an eye on all your favourite athletes even more? It’s sometimes hard to follow or see who is who from a distance and although there are screen with live video feed usually at stadiums, an AR camera app would also do the trick. Imagine you’re watching the 4 x 100m relay. Sure, you see by the shirts what team the runners are on, but you could also see their names and stats on the screen at the same time, to keep you completely updated. </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>Creating an interactive world in Unreal Engine</h3>
        <p>Since we had already had a workshop in making VR worlds with Unreal Engine before this topic of disucussion, we had a base game ready where the player collects bananas. I wanted to make the player a car and drive around the bananas, but I failed miserably and couldn't find any good tutorials online so here is the world I made with a lot more walls that just make banana collecting harder.</p>

        <h2>RESEARCH</h2>
        <p>Story of the Forest is a captivating AR exhibit in the National Museum of Singapore. It doesn't just feature Spatial projection mapping to make the whole experience immersive, it also offers an AR application. In a large environment a video of a forest is projected with different animals and inhabitants visiting it occassionally. Just like in Pokemon Go, the user has to get their phone out, capture that animal and they can learn more about it. They can collect these animals they spot. This is also a great educational tool. I know where I'm going if I ever go to Singapore.</p>

        <h2>REFLECTION</h2>
        <p>I found this an incredibly hard project because every idea I had ended up being alreday done by someone. I am not very fascinated by VR personally, although I see its benefits and as much as I find a lot of AR apps cool, I do feel like it just glues everyone to their phones even more. Here's my main reflection on the AR&VR topic assginments: Unreal Engine is hard.</p>
